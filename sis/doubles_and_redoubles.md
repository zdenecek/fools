## T/o X


|                  | 3 cards in their suit | singleton     | doubleton
| T/o X against 1m | 13+ vul 11+NV         | 10(9.5)+HCP   | 11+
| T/o X against 1M | 14+ vul 12+NV         | 10+HCP        | 11+


Only 4333 with four cards in their suit if good ODR, 14+ and four small.  
Against 1M, Vul or Unfav, 4oM is needed if you have only 11-13.  

Also used when they respond 1NT to a nF opening showing an anchor suit.  
If the opps have bid two suits the minimum for a double should be 4-4 in the unbid suits and 12+ (10+ by a passed hand)  
You can double with less strength on the 4th LIVE position if you're 5-4 with good suits.  

Against WJ - T/o of their 1♣ opening is a T/o of any minor.  
T/o X on 1m opening promises atleast xx in unbid minor (might be singleton w/4♠ 5♥)  
T/o X on natural 2♣ or higher opening promises xx+ in unbid minors.  
T/o X on any opening promisex xxx+ in unbid Majors or 21+ any.  
We do not like T/o X with shortness in oM.  
We do not like T/o X with lower-ranking suit.  


1st round of bidding: partners X is NOT for PEN (only in explicit sequences after preempts).  
X is T/o thru 5♦ in the first round of bidding.  
This does NOT apply In explicit sequences where doubles are clearly for PEN.  
If the double is on the 4-level, it will frequently be left in.  
Not because the partner of the doublerhas a trump stack (unlikely), but because he has nothing to take out to.  
If a 4-level bid is doubled for "takeout" you take it out with shape - a long suit (usually 5+ cards).  
If the partner of the doubler is 4333, he will typically leave it in and hope to beat them.  
But, don't lose the main point: **THE DOUBLE IS NOT INTENDED FOR PENALTIES**.  


##### (1♣)-p-(1♠!)

X
: T/o, 3+♠

##### (1m)-p-(1M)-p-(2M)

X
: T/o, good m + M shortness



### Reopen T/o X on the 1st lvl

X
: 8+ w/singleton in their suit, 9+ w/doubleton in their suit or 10+ w/3 cards in their suit

Avoid reopen T/o doubles with a void in opps suit on 1st level.  
Also look for alternatives on the second level (but X is acceptable if you have otherwise nice defensive values).  
Promises xx+ in unbid minors and xxx+ in unbid majors unless 15+ with own suit.


### T/o X against their PRE
If considering doubling with 0-2 cards in their PRE: double your values for your shortness in their suit.  
With 4 cards in their PRE suit, you do not adjust anything.  
With 3 cards or a 4333 distribution for a T/o X, you subtract 1 point from your hand.  
Also do not count anything for fragments like Qxxx/Jx/QJx in their PRE suit.  

T/o X requirements:
: against 2R 14+, against 2S, 3C, 3R 16+, against 3S and higher 18+

Reopen X requirements:
: depends on the level, reopen just so we do not miss games very often

Good ODR*
: add 1p *High cards factor only (no shape)

Fav vulnerability
: add 1p

W/o 4+ oM
: subtract 1p (or even 2p when Vul or Unfav against 2♠+)


T/o X against PRE promises xx+ in unbid minors and xxx+ in unbid majors, even on reopen  
(without these use cue or 3NT)



Both vul, IMPs, (2♠)-?  
x AQJ974 KT5 653 = 3♥ - good ODR, unbid M, doubled singleton


##### Against 4♥

X
: T/o 3+♠

4NT
: minors or 5♠ 5♦, better than 4♠



##### Against 4♠

4NT
: 5+ 5+ minors/5+ 5+ reds OR hearts-one suiter stronger than 5♥

X
: T/o Axx Axx AKTx Kxx (with 5440 and extra-offensive hands you can use 4NT) partner passes with defensive hand

pass
: may be PEN (for example AQJx Axx Qxx xxx)

Choose to pass a takeout double of 4♠ if you have a semi-balanced hand with fewer than 13 points, you'll often need extra power to survive the likely bad breaks. Also look if you have a doubleton in their trump suit. The pass is also lesser evil when you're so broke that both bidding or passing rates to be a disaster.  

With wild distributions that are undervalued by K&R (65, 66, 76) bid over wild preempts!

(4♠)-?  
x K987xx Axxx xx = X - partner may have something like 5♠ and he can not double on reopen

Both vul, IMPs, (4♠)-p-(p)-?  
x KQTx KQTx JTxx = X


### T/o X responses

1NT
: 5/6/7/8-11

2NT
: 12-13

3NT
: 14+

jump new suit
: 9-11, minor always 5+, Major can be only 4-card

double JNS
: nat INV (12-13, mostly distributional values)

cue
: INV+ with two+ places to play or GF with own 5+ suit

jump cue
: bid 3NT with this stopper

free bid 1st lvl
: 5+ w/4+ suit

free bid 2nd lvl
: 5+ w/5+ suit over 1NT, 7+ w/4+ suit if responder raises

(1a)-X-(1b)-X
: 7+ w/4+ card suit, PEN

(1a)-X-(1b)-2b
: 7-11 w/5+ card suit, nat

w/good 6m and bad 4M we prefer bidding the 6m first  
Cue forces the partnership to 2NT (or 3 in a suit if you raise it from 2nd lvl), 3♣+ by both is GF

West | North | East | South
1♥   | X     | pass | ?

♠876 ♥J10987♦ J4 ♣853


Lesser evil: cheapest m3  
1NT - partner expects points  
Pass - not even an option

(1♣)-X-(p)

pass
: may be gambling - the risk is small opposing to a potential reward



(1♣)-X-(1♠)

X
: 7+, 4+♠

2♠
: 7-11, 5+♠



This principle also applies at situations, where the responders bid is artificial:  
(1♣)-X-(1♠!)  
(1♣)-1R-(1♠!)  
(1♦)-1♥-(1♠!)  
(1♥)-X-(1♠!)


Or when we need to make sure no one is fooling us:  
(3a)-X-(3b)

(1♣)-X-(1R TRF)

X
: PEN

suit
: nat

Never be afraid to play in a 4-4 fit when you know that trumps are 4-1.

(1a)-X-(1NT)

X
: 7+, responsive 


### Inversion priority after their 1♠ opening

##### (1♠)-X-(pass)

1NT
: 0-8 (sbsq. eco suits 4+ 11-15 nF, cue 16-20 (sbsq. eco suits 4+ nF), 2NT 21+ (sbsq. eco suits 4+ “GF”)

2m and 2♥
: 9-11

rest
: normal


(1M)-X-(2M)-3M is a stopper ask w/long minor


##### (1♠)-X-(p)-2♠

2NT
: min (sbsq. economical scramble)

3m and 3♥
: GF, economical scramble



### Reopen T/o X on the 1st lvl responses

Suit no jump
: up to 11, if forced, promising nothing, else 1+ control or 5+
    
    1NT
    : 16-18

    2NT
    : 21-22

    own suit
    : 15+, 5+ cards

    cue
    : 12+, F, support

    raise
    : up to 11, semiPRE

1NT
: 6/7/8/9-11 - maybe more if p is passed hand

2nd lvl jump
: 12-13, decent 4+ cards

new suit 3rd lvl
: 14-15, 4+ cards

Cue
: 12-13, can be with own 4+suit when no 2nd lvl jump possible for that suit

2NT
: 14-15 w/stopper

3NT
: trapping pass, stopper x

jump cue
: trapping pass, no stopper x

pass
: PEN, rarely a good action, must be sensible, AQT9, KJ9x, QJ87x…



##### RHO bids (competitive bidding)

2M/1NT
: sound

2M/2a or 2b
: light

X
: if opener rebids his suit, then PEN
: if opener bids a new suit, then Responsive 

pass/XX
: PEN





 

### Subsequent T/o X bidding and Equal level conversion (ELC)

Doubling and then bidding a suit should show a big hand. There are auctions where you can,

by agreement, double and then bid a new suit without a big hand. The situations are specific so it is easy to define. If you double a suit for takeout and partner bids on the second level, you can bid your suit without a monster hand. This agreement is called Equal Level Conversion.

##### (1♣)-X-(p or bid)-1♠-(p)

1NT

2♥
: 17+ 2-3♣ or 21+ any

##### (1a)-X-(p or bid)-1b-(2a)

X
: 17+ w/3b

new suit
: 17+, nat (19+ 3rd lvl)

2b
: can be streteched now, so 15-18 w/4+b

3a
: 21+, stopper ask

rest
: same



##### (1a)-X-(p or bid)-1b-(3a)

new suit
: 19+ nat

rest
: same



##### (1a)-X-(p or bid)-1/2b-(X)

XX
: 15+ w/3b (17+ 2nd lvl)

rest
: same
 

##### (1a)-X-(p or bid)-1/2b-(2c)

Not playing 3 cuebids here  

2a
: 17+ w/3b

3a
: 21+, stopper ask

3c
: not defined

X
: 17+ DSI4

rest
: same



##### (1a)-X-(p)-1NT

ELC rules apply (it is on only if you bid a lower suit than opener has on the 2nd lvl)

2NT
: nat INV



##### After a T/o X and a jump suit advance (9-11) (Opener passes or doubles) (Responder may pass or bid)

XX
: INV+ w/3-card support, looking to penalise the opponents too

2NT
: 13-14 nat INV

raise
: INV

cue
: 15+ GF, seeking a stopper (w/3-card support after advancer has H, then advancer can choose),
: or 21+ any

New suit
: 15+ GF 5+suit (w/3-card support after advancer has H)



##### After a T/o X and a jump suit advance (9-11) (Opener rebids his suit) (Responder may pass or bid)

X
: INV+ DSI3 w/two sure trump tricks and 3-card support

raise
: INV w/4-card support



##### After a T/o X and a jump suit advance (9-11) (Opener bids a new suit or raises responder, who  may pass or bid)

X
: INV+ DSI3 w/3-card support

raise
: INV w/4-card support



##### After a double of a suit one-bid, a simple new-suit advance, and doubler's cue-bid

Any bid up to and including a simple bid of advancer's suit is negative.
 







## Negative X

Minor against minor
: both 4+M

Major against major
: almost always both 4+m

Minor against major
: 4+oM


1♠-(2♣)-X-(p)  
♠AQ9xx ♥Kxx ♦QJx ♣xx  
Bid 2♦. Partner can support diamonds with 5♦ or bid hearts with 5♥.

1m-(4♥)  
♠A92 ♥53 ♦K87642 ♣A5  
The answer is X, even without 4 spades - facing 4♥ or higher PRE, the double might be more flexible.

Cue on partner’s Negative X is forcing but does not know where to play - similar to a cue after T/o X.



## Thrump X

1m-(3M)  
Also used in specific sequences after 4th hand overcalls our offensive bidding – see exact situations



## Support X

1st lvl
: no extras needed

2♣, 2♦, 2♥
: positional extras needed (not 4333 11HCP etc.)



West | North | East | South
–    | –     | –    | 1♦
Pass | 1♠    | 2♥   | ?

♠Kx ♥x ♦AJxxxx ♣AKxx  

Sometimes we need to be creative. Double.  


Support doubles are ON only up to the level of our 2M.  
Also played if the second defender didnt pass (all four players bid in the first round).  
Higher level double: Check offensive bidding, second defender overcalls.

## Maximal overcall X

##### 1♥-(2m or X)-2♥-3♦, 1♠-(2♥)-2♠-(3♥),  1♠-(2m or X)-2♠-(3♥) and (1♥)-p or X or 1♠-(2♥)-2♠-(3♥)

X
: NV

3♠
: no extras

4♥
: sound

4♠
: offensive

4m
: nat


##### 1♠-(2♦)-2♠-(3♦)

X
: 17+, DSI4

3♥
: INV

3♠
: offensive



##### 1♠-(2♣)-2♠-(3♣)

X
: 17+, PEN potential

3♠
: offensive

3R
: INV, better values here than in the oR



The concept of Maximal overcall double is used both in offensive and defensive bidding situations. 

## Responsive X

When they bid and raise - even with Jordan, Jacoby etc.  
When partner OCs their 1x opening on the first lvl and RHO bids 1NT - may be converted.  
When they bid two suits and partner doubles 4th hand LIVE and opener raises responders suit.  
When partner reopens their opening with a X, opener bids a new lower ranking suit.  
When partner doubles their opening, you advance with a 1 in a suit, opener rebids his suit


Attention: the double would be PEN if:  
Partner reopens their opening with a X, opener rebids his suit.  
They bid two suits and partner partner doubles 4th hand LIVE and opener rebids his suit.


(1a)-X-(2a)-2NT - scrambling instead of Resp X: promises real values while Resp X is competitive only.  
*This SCR as Resp X used after partners T/o X only!*


Partner bids Resp X? Prefer to bid nice 3 suit he promises rather than your weak 6-suit.  
Partner uses cue instead of Resp X? (after your T/o X)  
He has own suit with mild slam invite or wants to play 3NT.

##### (1♠)-X-(2♠)

X
: minor responsive w/competitive values only

2NT
: INV+, minor Scrambling

3m
: nat, 5+, 9+

3♥
: nat 4+, 9+

3♠
: GF, suit oriented, 4+♥

3♠ thru 2NT
: stopper ask

4m
: GF, “Leaping Michaels”

4♠
: 5+♣ 5♦

4NT
: 5+♣ 6+♦



## Rosenkranz X and XX

##### (1x)-1M-(1 or 2y) 1y if y>x 2y if y<x

X
: Sound raise (9-10)

2M
: Light raise (5-8)



##### (1x)-1M-(X)

XX
: Tophonor

Rest
: TRF scheme



Rosenkranz XX also used when partner overcalls 4th hand LIVE. 



## Snapdragon X

(1♣)-1♦-(1M)

X
: 5oM + 2♦



Also used when:  
Partner reopens their opening with his own suit, opener bids a new lower ranking suit on the second level.  
When they bid two suits and partner overcalls 4th hand LIVE, opener rebids his suit or raises responder.



Attention, the double would be PEN if:  
Partner reopens their opening with his own suit, opener rebids his suit. 

## X against their artificial calls

TRF (5+)
: lead-dir ("accept their TRF" = T/o 2nd lvl, two-suiter 3rd+ lvl)

TRF (4+)
: PEN ("accept their TRF" = nat)

STAY
: good biddable clubs (5+ suit, 3+ honors, w/100% side trick if suit not AKQxx+)

2NT-3C
: even more sound

SPL
: lead-dir to lower-ranking suit than the SPL - e.g. (1♠)-p-(4♣)-X is hearts

Fragment
: lead-dir to the suit he bid his fragment thru - e.g. (1♦)-1♠-(3♣)-X is clubs

Cue (mixed+)
: RHO has stolen my call

Cue (slam)
: lead-dir

Drury
: biddable clubs

Swiss
: lead-dir

Namyats TRF
: lead-dir

Texas TRF
: lead-dir

Namyats OP
: T/o on his M 

Surrogate ctrl
: lead-dir to whatever suis is written on the bidding card



## Against FJ/Bergen raises

(1♠)-p-(3m)

X
: T/o on their M, 5440/5oM+5m or great 4441/5431

(1♠)-x-(3m)

X
: PEN

(1♥)-1♠-(3m)

X
: Shows same type of hand as South



## Lightner X

Against suit small slams:  
If the doubler has bid a suit before:  
Do not lead a trump.  
Do not lead my suit.  
Lead your longer unbid suit - i might have a void.  
If that is very unlikely:  
Look for a dummys first 3+ suit and lead it.  
If there is none such a suit: Lead preferably a heart (or a club if hearts are trumps).  
If the doubler has not bid a suit before:  
Lead your longer unbid suit - i might have a void.  
Also might have AK somewhere if you believe they skipped a control.



## Lead-dir X against 3NT

They did not seek Majors:  
Lead your worse Major  
They did seek Majors:  
Do not lead any suid we have bid.  
Look for a dummys first 3+ suit and lead it.

If there is none such a suit, lead a diamond.

After opener's reverse/jump shift:  
Lead the first suit bid by the opener.



## PEN X
We have showed a fit and they pre-balanced and Maximal X does not have to be used.  
We were passive in auction (first round) and suddenly we wake up and X on the 3rd+ level.  
When RHO rebids his M or rebids his m after 1m-1NT-2m.  
We are already GF and they start bidding.  
We doubled their NT for PEN before unless they naturally run with long suit.  
We redoubled for PEN before and then doubled opps with our first chance (2nd lvl or higher), (pass, then X = DSI2).  
If we already converted a T/o X to PEN.  
After our PRE opening or overcall.  
We've made a card-showing double before (for example double of a Michaels cuebid).  
When partner reopens their opening with his own suit and opener rebids his suit.  
Partner reopens their opening with a X, opener rebids his suit.  
They bid two suits and partner partner doubles 4th hand LIVE and opener rebids his suit.  
They bid three or four suits and end in NT.



They bid two suits and end in NT:  
Partner Xs    2- cards in LHO suit = it is for PEN, lead the suit.  
3+ cards in LHO suit = take it out


MP = 20% of their doubled contracts can be made  
Try a PEN X of their GAME contract with 100% two defensive tricks after partner has shown 11+HCP   
We use stripe-tailed monkey X  
We do not play "negative slam doubles"

## DSI doubles concept

Inbetween the T/o and PEN double there is something that needs to be defined to play bridge properly.  

* DSI1 is a normal takeout double, which is supposed to be taken out.
* DSI2 suggests a take/out, but not necessarily. With a suitable trump stack, it can be converted easily.
* DSI3 is purely neutral and leaves the decision to partner.
* DSI4 suggests penalizing the opps, but not necessarily. You can pull the double with extra unbid offense, often accompanied by lack of expected defense, or when you feel that playing and making our own contract is clearly going to be more lucrative in long term.
* DSI5 is a normal penalty double, which is supposed to stand, unless something truly extraordinary is happening, like when you psyched before.

DSI3 and 4 often declare our ownership of the hand. Partner should make an intelligent action. Used in specific sequences.



## The Rule of 9

So how do you know when it's right to go for blood?  
The "Rule of 9", popularized by Mel Colchamiro, offers some advice. It suggests that you add up your number of trump cards, number of trump tophonors (A/K/Q), (JT8/JT9 equal to 1) and the level of the contract.  
If the total is nine or more, you can safely pass partner's double for penalties. If it's eight or fewer, you should bid. This can be a handy general guideline, but like most bidding "rules", it's a simplification that shouldn't be a substitute for good judgment. There are several other factors that affect your decision, including vulnerability, whether you're over or under the bidder, your length and strength in other suits, the form of scoring, even your partnership's competitive bidding style.  
After reopen X: A/K/Q/J/T for one point, rest the same. 

West | North | East | South
3♣   | X     | Pass | ?

♠6 ♥K♦A109863 ♣Q8542

Pass.



## Redoubles

Redouble on the first level in the first round of bidding suggests penalizing opps later, promises 9+HCP with a good lead. All later doubles are for penalty.



##### We XX and they bid a suit (this treatment applies by both players):

X
: 4+ trumps

pass
: F w/mostly 2-3 trumps

NT
: nat, nF w/stopper, not doubling them at all if they hold this suit (mostly at unfav vulnerability)

OP suit by RE
: INV w/3-card support



##### We XX and advancer passes - opener:

pass
: GF any (but not very offensive) or weak bal

new suit
: 5+ 5(4)+, offensive or min

rebid suit
: 6+suit, min

jumps
: semiPRE w/minimal strength and freakish distributions



If you bid constructively and then redouble your own suit contract, it means business.  
When our side has shown 22+HCP, redouble is always business.  
XX is business when they X our RKC 4NT cue or any of those: 4NT INV, 5NT GSF, 5NT pick a slam.  
In other situations (and also when there is no special explicit meaning), redouble is SOS.

XX of our cue(mixed+) = at least halfstopper, NT seeking.  
Rosenkranz XX when they X our 1st level overcall, also after our 4th suit live 1st level overcall.

##### They XX for PEN

pass
: two+ places to play

new suit
: one place to play

jump new suit
: nat PRE

2NT
: 55+ lowest unbids

cue
: 55+ highest unbids



##### Partner doubles, any opponent redoubles:

Pass is penalty if you are over (to the left of) the opponent who bid the suit.  
Pass is noncommittal if you are under (to the right of) the bidder.
