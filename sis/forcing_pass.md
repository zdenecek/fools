# Forcing pass

When we are in GF auction and they stole our call - X is for PEN with QJ9x or better holding in their suit.  
With worse holding, just pass and then convert partners reopen double (rarely done on the low levels).  
After a forcing pass, responder should support our suit as a priority number one, had that not happened before.  
Responder reopens forcing pass with Lebensohl style if their overcall was up to 2♠.  
We are in (almost) GF auction after 2♣ and 2♣-2♦ - forcing pass is played in explicit sequences.  
We redoubled for PEN - either we play something or they play something doubled, so pass is forcing.  

Setup Rules:  
Direct raise in partners suit never setups a forcing pass.  
FJ, FNJ and SPL setups a forcing pass only when Unfav  
Cue showing support setups forcing pass only when it forces partner to 4th+ level  
LR+ setups forcing pass only if the opps bid to the 5th+ level (NOT 4♠)

West | North | East | South
-    | -     | 1♥   | pass

pass
: extras

X
: GF, DSI4

3♥
: no extras

We don‘t play forcing pass when:  
+ We double their weak NT and they start running.
+ We already converted a T/o X before.

### Singleton rule 
You (or your partner) have shown two suits or partner has bid balanced hand.  
Your side had showed 21+HCP and fit and RHO bids a game.  

Pass
: at most singleton

X
: 2+ in RHO suit

You have showed balanced hand - X with honours in their suit.  
  
When none of the above apply and forcing pass is set up on the higher levels:   
Bid on with good to excellent ODR - depends on the situation  
X means that you are scared to go higher, rather take a sure plus, no great offense  
Pass is forcing – if not bidding nor doubling seems like a clear action, let partner decide  
  
After you have limited your hand too much, let partner always decide.  
Both NS and EW have shown support? New suit is nat, suggesting a sacrifice, not lead-dir.

PASS IS FORCING ONLY IN THESE VERY SPECIFIC SITUATIONS.  
**ZERO FLEXIBILITY.**  
IF YOU HAVE TO REALLY ASK IF THE PASS IS FORCING – THEN IT IS NOT.
