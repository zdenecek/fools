# Direct and 4th hand LIVE suit overcalls
*Why overcall?*  
We steal bidding space from our opponents.  
Partner can find a good lead he would not be able to find otherwise.  
We can get into a good partscore or even game/slam.  
Partner can preempt or find a good sacrifice.  
See article by Grant Robinson (Part I.)  

ODR-based overcalls are better than Vul-based, although we tend to be more sound when Vul.  
Be more sound with spades, there is no need to hurry.   

Overcalling at MP is not normal bridge.  
If chances are good, we can risk a marginal TOP-score. Sometimes -800 is the result, it is no problem.     If you are not ready to risk your "life" every time you need to overcall, better play only Swiss teams. If you are not ready to overcall with bad hands at MP, you are bound to have many average results, but you are not going to win any titles.  

## 1st lvl direct OC  
At MP might be with good hand but bad suit (bad bridge).  
At MP or NV IMP might me bad hand with good suit (bad bridge).  
Almost no upper limit - equal level conversion after our T/o double ("strong on own suit" 21+)  
<br>

T7654 Ax AKxx Kx
: OK even at IMPs

75432 KJ KQ7 KJ5
: OK at MP  

KQT8x xxx xx xxx
: OK even at IMPs NV  

ATxxx QJx QT Jxx
: Not even at MP, horrible ODR, can stand other leads  

May have 4card Major only, but then have:  
1. 14+HCP  
2. 5+ minor (partner has to be ready for this, but still this is very uncommon)  

4th hand LIVE: same requirements.  

## 2nd lvl direct OC  
- Sound - look at the number of cards in RHO suit  
- 4+ cards are excellent, 3 cards are horrible, 0-1 cards are good, 2 cards are uninspiring  
- ODR-based  
- Good localization of honors  
- No upper limits again, except for hands with 21+, they can go thru X.  

The minimum for a vulnerable two-level overcall should be:  
- a 6-card suit w/11+ or  
- a 5-card with at least KQJ9x, AKJ9x or if the lowest card is eight w/14+  
NV overcalls can be done with worse suit.  

## 4th hand LIVE OC  
Be more sound. You need tricks, not HCP.  
Against 2/1 (9+) be even more sound.Wide-range.  

## Ambiguous overcalls  

(1M)-3M
: ask for stopper  

(1m)-3m
: nat PRE if 1m promises minimum 3 cards or fewer, else ask for stopper  

(1m)-p-(1M)  

2m
: Michaels, unless 1m promise 3 cards os less, then nat  

2M
: nat

Four cuebids when responding to a 4th hand LIVE suit overcall  
Only applies when we have two cues on the 2nd level available.  
Responder uses partners 10K&R as the minimal strength for his overcall.  
3rd lvl = four+ trumps: direct raise is PRE, higher cuebid is mixed, lower cuebid is INV+  
2nd lvl = three trumps: direct raise is PRE, higher cuebid is simple raise, lower cuebid is INV+  
Attention: also applies when they bid a 4th hand LIVE sandwich 1NT promising two unbids.  

#### Three cuebids  
*When three cuebids are avaliable for the support of partners 4th hand LIVE overcall below the level of 3 of his suit, it goes as this:*  

lowest cue
: INV+ w/3+card support  

middle cue
: undefined (unless the highest cue would consume the space for range-ask, then mixed)  

highest cue

# Overcalling their PRE with a suit

Your call | Direct | Direct jump | Reopen | Reopen jump
2M        | 14+    | -           | 10+    | -
3m        | 16+    | -           | 12+    | -
3M        | 16+    | 18+ 6+suit  | 12+    | 4-5LTC 6+suit
4M        | 18+    | 18+ 6+ suit | 16+    | to play with adequate cards



Be sound on reopen on the third level. 


Mostly when you have 3+ cards in LHO suit - partner is likely to have max 2 and he has not bid.  
Off-shape, poor suit, bad ODR, no 3NT prospect, no 3+ unbid M = pass!

Both vul, IMP (3♦)-p-(p)-?  
xx xxx xx AKQ9xx = pass - maybe in MP or if it was a major.

# PRE-balancing

##### (1M)-p-(2M)

X
: 4-5 oM and 4+m

2NT
: light - 5oM+5m

3M
: sound - 5oM+5m

3NT
: to play

4NT
: light minors

Suit
: nat - remember you only do this so partner would not balance w/e.g. 5 cards in higher ranking suit and find your singleton/void when you have a good 6 bagger in lower ranking suit



##### (1m)-p-(2m)

X
: T/o w/44++ Majors

3NT
: to play

Suit
: nat - remember you only do this so partner would not balance w/e.g. 5 cards in higher ranking suit and find your singleton/void when you have a good 6 bagger in lower ranking suit



##### (1x)-p-(2♣) 2+♣

X
: PEN, sound, some defence is preferable so they do not find a marginal slam

2x
: T/o

2NT
: 55 unbids - wide-range

3♣
: nat PRE, less defense than X



##### (1x)-p-(2y) 2/1 9+

2NT
: offensive unbids

4NT
: extra offensive unbid


If they XX partners Pre-balancing X, pass is PEN



# Balancing
Up to 2♠

X of 2NT or higher
: DSI4


##### (1♠)-p-(2♠)-p-(p)

X
: T/o or ♣+♥ T/o (w/♦ preference, advancer bids 2NT (sbsq. 3♦ regular, 3♣ ♣+♥)

2NT
: T/o ♦+♣ or ♦+♥ (dynamic)


##### (1♥)-p-(2♥)-p-(p)

X
: T/o w/3♠

2♠
: 4+♠

2NT
: minor T/o


When you pass and then freely bid the suit of your RHO when partner has passed too = nat

Examples:

1♣-(1♠)-p-(2♦)-p-(p)

2♠
: nat, excellent 5+♠, trapping pass in 1st round


OPPs 1st lvl overcall
: not their suit

OPPs 1st lvl 4+mening
: not their suit



(1♣)-1♦-(p)-p-(1NT)-p-(p)

2♣
: nat, nF - no way to bid this in the 1st round



## Reopening after their preempts

2NT/2♦
: 14-18        STAY on, TRF on

2NT/2♥
: in-between    nat responses

2NT/2♠
: 15-19        nat responses

jump 3x
: good suit and 4-5 losers

3NT no jump
: 16-21, stoppers or source of minor tricks

3NT jump
: probably source of minor tricks, with real 3NT rather bid X and then NT/cue

## Lebensohl

a) after we double their 2M opening preempt, on reopen too (not when we are both passed hands - SCR)

2NT
: "forces" 3♣ -  other bid by overcaller than 3♣ are nat INV, may even use cue with 20+

pass or correct with weak lower-ranking suit

3m
: nat 9.5-11 after ♥, 8-11 after ♠

4m and 4M
: Same principle as if they intervened our 1NT opening

cue thru 2NT
: stopper ask

cue
: 4+oM, GF

3NT
: to play, no extras

3NT thru 2NT
: to play w/extras



##### (2♥)-X-(p)

2♠
: 4+♠ nF

3♠
: 5+♠ INV 

3♠ thru 2NT
: 4♠ INV



##### (2♠)-X-(p)

3♥
: 5♥ INV

3♥ thru 2NT
: teak


b) after openers reverse or 1C-1D-2S

c) when forcing pass is set (2/1 GF or xyz) and they intervene up to 2♠, LEB rules apply ON REOPEN

Cue
: Moderate support for partners suit

3NT
: to play w/no stopper

3NT thru 2NT
: to play w/stopper

Cue thru 2NT
: exactly halfstopper



Extras: jump in higher-ranking suit, new suit 3rd lvl in lower-ranking suit (clubs does not promise)

No extras: do not jump in higher-ranking suit, bid via 2NT in lower-ranking suit (not w/clubs)



d) (1M)-p-(2M)-X-(p)

e) Responder reopens Lebensohl style after partners opening, responders initial action (not limited up to 10 though), second defender overcalls on the second level, and two passes (2NT = puppet, suit = INV)



## 2NT Scrambling

When 2NT has no explicit meaning, and it is clear a game cannot be reached, use 2NT as scrambling.

Scrambling 2NT show 2-3 possible suits to play in and you are not sure which one.

Mostly used on reopen, but also in live sequences where Lebensohl is off and 2NT couldnt be INV+ with support etc.


after X:

2NT
: no 5+ suit

3a
: 5+ suit


Strain before level.

##### 1m-(2M)-p-(p)-X-(p)

After a reopening double of 2♥ or 2♠, responder’s 2NT is a scramble, initially aiming to find the best minor-suit fit, typically with 5om/3m or perhaps 4♣/2-3♦ (after a 1♦ opening). However, scrambling with 2NT and converting three-of-a-minor to 3♥ (after a 2♠) overcall is invitational in ♥. Converting to 3♠ (after a 2♥ overcall of our 1m) suggests only four spades, while a jump to 3♠ directly over the reopening double suggests at least five (this also applies for LEB over 2M preemptive openings).

 

# Weak jump overcalls

1st pos
: 5-10 (sbsq. 2NT ask for strength)

2nd pos
: 7-10,(sbsq. 2NT ask for feature)

3rd and 4th pos
: 0-13(16), wide-range (sbsq. 2NT w/a good support and maximum of pass)



## Intermediate jump Overcalls

(1♠)-3♥ when vulnerable - 6+♥ 11-14



## WJO notes

If they X, partner can PEN XX, but!:

Then there should be one suit that he would NOT double for PEN, this means the preemptor needs to do that. If you have them doubled everywhere they would run from our XX contract, just pass and wait…



Both vul, RHO opens 1♦ and you hold Txxx xx x KQJT8x - don't PRE  
On the other table(s) the players could pass thinking the preempt is unacceptable.  
Your preempt would push them into hardly biddable slam based on partial club exclusion.  
Especially at IMPs, this could be an unnecessary swing.  
W/o M4, the preempt would seem OK. But do not off-shape preempt when they could make sub minimal slam.


We do not play "negative" slam doubles. If the preemptor doubles = good PEN.



## Responding to WJOs
 
##### (1x)-2M-(3x/3y F1+) <br> p-(1x)-2M-(3y nF)

X
: sacrifice maybe to 4M

3M
: push bid


##### After our 3m or higher WJO and RHO bids:

3NT
: sacrifice maybe to 5m

4m
: push bid

4NT/5NT
: (mostly after higher) maybe a sacrifice to 6/7

4m/5m/6m
: push bid



Passed hand: 4M and 5♦ is FJ/FNJ, never to play after partner has preempted


One test for a potential WJO is to imagine an ordinary (not perfect) 7 points in partner's hand.  
If that would give you a play for your contract, your hand is probably worth a bid.
