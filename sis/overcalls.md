## Direct and 4th hand LIVE suit overcalls
*Why overcall?*  
We steal bidding space from our opponents.  
Partner can find a good lead he would not be able to find otherwise.  
We can get into a good partscore or even game/slam.  
Partner can preempt or find a good sacrifice.  
See article by Grant Robinson (Part I.)  

ODR-based overcalls are better than Vul-based, although we tend to be more sound when Vul.  
Be more sound with spades, there is no need to hurry.   

Overcalling at MP is not normal bridge.  
If chances are good, we can risk a marginal TOP-score. Sometimes -800 is the result, it is no problem.     If you are not ready to risk your "life" every time you need to overcall, better play only Swiss teams. If you are not ready to overcall with bad hands at MP, you are bound to have many average results, but you are not going to win any titles.  

### 1st lvl direct OC  
At MP might be with good hand but bad suit (bad bridge).  
At MP or NV IMP might me bad hand with good suit (bad bridge).  
Almost no upper limit - equal level conversion after our T/o double ("strong on own suit" 21+)

T7654 Ax AKxx Kx
: OK even at IMPs

75432 KJ KQ7 KJ5
: OK at MP  

KQT8x xxx xx xxx
: OK even at IMPs NV

ATxxx QJx QT Jxx
: Not even at MP, horrible ODR, can stand other leads  

May have 4card Major only, but then have:  
1. 14+HCP  
2. 5+ minor (partner has to be ready for this, but still this is very uncommon)  

4th hand LIVE: same requirements.  

### 2nd lvl direct OC  
- Sound - look at the number of cards in RHO suit  
- 4+ cards are excellent, 3 cards are horrible, 0-1 cards are good, 2 cards are uninspiring  
- ODR-based  
- Good localization of honors  
- No upper limits again, except for hands with 21+, they can go thru X.  

The minimum for a vulnerable two-level overcall should be:  
- a 6-card suit w/11+ or  
- a 5-card with at least KQJ9x, AKJ9x or if the lowest card is eight w/14+  
NV overcalls can be done with worse suit.  

### 4th hand LIVE OC  
Be more sound. You need tricks, not HCP.  
Against 2/1 (9+) be even more sound.Wide-range.  

### Ambiguous overcalls  

(1M)-3M
: ask for stopper  

(1m)-3m
: nat PRE if 1m promises minimum 3 cards or fewer, else ask for stopper  

(1m)-p-(1M)

Four cuebids when responding to a 4th hand LIVE suit overcall  
Only applies when we have two cues on the 2nd level available.  
Responder uses partners 10K&R as the minimal strength for his overcall.  
3rd lvl = four+ trumps: direct raise is PRE, higher cuebid is mixed, lower cuebid is INV+  
2nd lvl = three trumps: direct raise is PRE, higher cuebid is simple raise, lower cuebid is INV+  
Attention: also applies when they bid a 4th hand LIVE sandwich 1NT promising two unbids.  

#### Three cuebids  
*When three cuebids are avaliable for the support of partners 4th hand LIVE overcall below the level of 3 of his suit, it goes as this:*  

lowest cue
: INV+ w/3+card support  

middle cue
: undefined (unless the highest cue would consume the space for range-ask, then mixed)  

highest cue
: mixed (unless it consumes the space for range-ask, then undefined)
