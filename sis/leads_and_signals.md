## Leads against NT

If not specified, lead the top of a sequence

|     |                                                                                        |                                   |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| A   | AKx, Ax, AKQx (rare - for SP)                                                          | unblock Qx, Qxx, Tx, Txx, JT, JTx |
| K   | Kx, AK, AKQx, KQx, (AKx against 5th or 6th lvl contracts or against declarers preempt) | unblock J                         |
| Q   | Qx, QJx, (AKQx - partner can signal count - low = even)                                | promises 0 or 2 higher cards      |
| J   | Jx, JTx, AKQJx, KQJx, AQJx                                                             | promises 0 or 2 higher cards      |
| T   | Tx, T9x, AJTx, KJTx                                                                    | promises 0 or 2 higher cards      |
| 9   | 9x, 98x, QT9x, KT9x, AT9x                                                              |                                   |
| low | 4th best from an honour, higher from doubleton, 2nd highest of nothing,                |                                   |
|     | lowest from 3rd honor, 8 denies a higher card unless H98, HT8                          |                                   |

When you lead from the top of a sequence and your lead takes the first trick,
lead low or lowest from the sequence if you want your partner to unblock.

When your partner leads something and you take the trick, return the suit:

- Higher from doubleton
- Third from even number
- Lowest from odd number

### Later NT leads

Ace denies king so a positive signal from partner promises the king  
King does not deny ace or queen  
Queen does not deny jack  
Jack, ten and nine still promise 0 or 2 higher cards  
Fourth from an honour, but if we fear the low card would appear too high for
partner, lead 5th or 6th or 7th  
Third from Hxx  
If there is no importance of our holding in our suit, lead count - low = even  
When you take the trick (not the 1st trick) with an honour, next lead low in
this suit = odd current number

### Signals

Ace lead King lead Queen lead Jack lead

8 lead T or 9 lead small lead

#### Reverse Smith Echo

Only applies in the 2nd trick

Both defenders signal, unless the partner of the opening leader showed his
attitude clearly in the 1st round  
In that case, the non-leading defender signals his current holding in the suit
led in the 1st trick (low = odd)  
Both defenders signal, unless the opening lead was the eight.  
In that case, the opening leader signals his current holding in the suit he led
in the 1st trick (low = odd)

|            |                                                                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ace**    | Queen promises J, small promises Q or length, J is negative but can have the ten            |
| **King**   | Unblock some holdings, Jxx = positive attitude, J is either JT, JTx or Jx, T denies Jack    |
| **Queen**  | Unblock Jx, small is positive with A/K/T, T denies Jack                                     |
| **Jack**   | a) Dummy does NOT control the suit and declarer can have A9xx - attitude, low = has the ten |
|            | b) Dummy does control the suit or declarer can't have 4+ cards - Reese count                |
| **8**      | Attitude, low = encouragement                                                               |
| **T or 9** | Play your honor, if you don't have, then show Reese Count                                   |
| **Small**  | If Ace or King is played by dummy, show attitude                                            |
|            | If Queen is played by dummy, show Reese count                                               |
|            | 3 cards - play the highest, even J from Jxx                                                 |
|            | 2 or 5 cards - play the lowest                                                              |
|            | 4 cards - play the second lowest                                                            |

## Suit leads

| Lead             | Examples                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A**            | AKx, Ax, AKQx (rare - for SP)                                                             |
| **K**            | Kx, AK, AKQx, KQx, (AKx against 5th or 6th level contracts or against declarer's preempt) |
| **Q**            | Qx, QJx, (AKQx - partner can signal count - low = even)                                   |
| **J**            | Jx, JTx, AKQJx, KQJx, AQJx                                                                |
| **T**            | Tx, T9x, AJTx, KJTx                                                                       |
| **9**            | 9x, 98x, QT9x, KT9x, AT9x                                                                 |
| **From H**       | Lowest from odd number of cards, 3rd from Hxxx, 4th from Hxxxxx                           |
| **From Nothing** | Top of nothing, lower from a doubleton                                                    |

When your partner leads something and you take the trick, return the suit:

- Higher from doubleton
- Third from even number
- Lowest from odd number

### Later suit leads

Same as NT

### Trump signals

Suit preference

Alternative signal: count, initiated mostly by partners unusual play

### What to signal

Ace and King generally ask for attitude - low = enc  
Queen and lower generally ask for count - low = even  
When declarer leads his suit, we can sometimes signal count in that suit - low =
even  
Suit preference when sending a ruff or when attitude and count had been already
shown or are irrelevant

### When not to signal attitude

| Scenario                                                                    | Highest                                  | Lowest      | 2nd Lowest or Middle |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| Partner has led A (has AK almost certainly) and dummy has Qxx(x+)           | 3+                                       | Doubleton   | |
| Partner has led A, we have shown 3+ cards in bidding                        | Odd                                      | Even + SP L | Even + no SP L       |
| Declarer controls at least the 2nd round of the suit led                    | SP H                                     | SP L        | Neutral              |
| Dummy controls at least the 2nd round of the suit led and has 5/4+ trumps   | SP H                                     | SP L        | Neutral              |
| Dummy controls at least the 2nd round of the suit led and has 5+/3 trumps\* | Attitude                                 | Attitude    |                      |
| Dummy has Jxxx(+)                                                           | Odd                                      | Even        |                      |
| Opening leader can see 10 cards between his hand and dummy                  | Doubleton                                | Singleton   |                      |
| We have shown 6+ cards in the suit our partner has led                      | Extremes are SP, others are for attitude | 
| Partner leads a King against small slam                                     | Odd                                      | Even        |                      |
| Cash-out: it is obvious that partner has AK+A & he needs to know the count  | Odd                                      | Even        |                      |
| Cash-out: 5th level, dummy and maybe declarer too have 2+ cards in the suit | Odd                                      | Even        |                      |
| (Cash-out: 5th level) If we have shown 3-4 cards in the suit led by partner | Odd + SP H                               | Even + SP L | Even + no SP L       |
| (Cash-out: 5th level) If we have shown 5+ cards in the suit led by partner  | 5 + SP H                                 | 6 + SP L    | 6 + no SP L          |
| The opening lead was a disaster and there is no chance for 2+ tricks here   | SP H                                     | SP L        |                      |

Partner has 5+ cards, leads Ace and there is xxx in dummy - signal the Jxx
holding with positive attitude as you would have the Queen.

\*With supposed 4/4 trumps (could be 5+/4 but we do not know) attitude is
signaled if one of the defenders has 0-1 or 4-5 trumps

If leading a high card under the general rule of second-highest from a worthless
holding, if the two highest cards held are equals, the normal lead is the
highest equal (not the first lead at NT except T9x, 98x)

If leading a high card under the general rule of second-highest from a worthless
holding, if the two highest cards held are equals, the normal lead is the
highest equal (not the first lead at NT except T9x, 98x)

## Discards (both suit and NT)

| Italian |                                                              |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| odd     | this suit                                                    |
| even    | SP for another suit                                          |
| honour  | promises at least one lower honour and denies a higher honor |

If partner leads his long suit against NT and then discards it, do not lead it
again.  
If partner leads his long suit against NT and then discards odd of another suit,
it does not have to be a real signal, he has just nothing to play.

## Various notes

### Singleton ambiguity

When you worry about your partner recognising your lead was a singleton, do not
give him chance for an alternative play - cash out the ace in the sidesuit Or
take the trick with an unnecesarilly high card = wake up, partner! Now I lead my
singleton. When you do not know if partners lead was a singleton, try to cash
out the ace in the sidesuit Look for partners signal, when he play low, it is
encouraging and it was not a singleton When you do not know if partners lead was
a singleton and declarer takes the trick, Look for partners signal in the next
trick, low in the suit that the declarer has led = it was singleton lead!
Low/mid lvl contracts: K from AK, then leading your partners suit (bid) =
singleton

### AKQ

If partner leads a suit and we have AKQ, the normal play is QAK.

|     |           |
| --- | --------- |
| AKQ | SP H      |
| QKA | SP L      |
| KQA | SP trumps |

### Partner executes an unusual play

- He is asking us to unblock
- He is asking for an alternative signal

### Defending against signals

When LHO leads and you have to play something from your hand eventually, signal
the same way as your RHO  
If they play low = enc, play low if you like your LHO to continue the suit and
vice versa  
If they play SP, play low if you like your LHO to continue in a lower ranking
suit etc.  
If only one of the defenders are relevant and he knows that we have a certain
card, get rid of it ASAP.

### Congratulatory jack

A defender's unnecessary play of a jack after a deal's outcome has been decided,
to acknowledge partner's superior defense
