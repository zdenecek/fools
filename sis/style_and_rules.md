# Style and rules

T/o X
: light

1st lvl OC
: moderate

2nd+ lvl OC	
: sound

preempts	
: moderate

psychics
: seldom
: 1st round of bidding by responder
: deceptive leads

INVs
: sound

3rd/4th M OP
: 10+, may be 4 cards only w/♠
  
 
In most sequences, when you bid your suit three times, you promise KQJTxx or better.
In one over one situation, where we can see slam aspirations, we may skip a very poor 4M suit.
Note: you need another reason to do this (AKQx oM or 4333 distribution).
If we have 9+ cards in a major, it is trumps.
No new trump suits at the fourth level.
When facing 2NT INV (not after we have shown a 6+ carder), 3m is nat weak, 3M is GF 3-card fragment if the partner has bid that M, or shortness if he had bid 1NT before and we are not limited yet.
55 hands w/9HCP that are clear openers: consider passing with weak short holdings (especially vul).
55 hands w/10HCP - always bid - it's safer to open at the one-level than to pass and act later, especially vul.

## Srs control bids and non-srs slam tries – the introduction
Fast Arrival principle applies.

Only when partner shows GF and extras, the Fast Arrival is rare. It should be made on a sub-minimum, less than 11.5HCP, not working values. With a normal opening, we almost always use srs/non-srs control bids.

Opener uses the srs/non-srs depending on the zone he has already shown before.

11-20
: = up to 14.5 is no extras, e.g. 1♠-2♥-4♥
: = 14.5 and more is extras, e.g. 1♠-2♥-3♥

After opener's 3♥, responder thus bids srs/non-srs controls – no Fast Arrival, as our GF should be sound.


12.5-15.5
: = no extras, bid non-srs control, partner will continue to search for a slam with 17.5+

15.5+
: = extras, bid srs S/T

If the opener's range has been limited more:

11-16/18
: = 11.0-12.0   non-working super-minimum – e.g. in 1♦-1♥-1♠-2♦-2♥-3♥* now just bid 4♥

11-16/18
: = 12.0-14.5   not real extras – bid non-srs S/T
: = 14.5+       real extras, bid serious control
	
11-13
: = 11.5-12.5   or not working values at all - bid non-srs S/T
: = 12.5-14.00  or a really nice working minimum – bid serious control
	
\*3♥ is already extras (he could bid four)
