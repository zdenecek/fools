### Against weak 1NT

X
: PEN (see below how much you need)

2♣
: forces 2♦ from partner

2♦
: transfer to hearts

2♥
: both majors, preferably 9+ cards (responder may pass or adjust to 2♠)

2♠
: spades (natural bid)

2NT
: TRF to clubs, wide-range

3♣

##### After 2♣ forcing partner to bid 2♦

2M
: 5M 4+m (sbsq. 2NT ask for the minor, 3♣ p/c, 3♦ INV+ w/support for partners M)

2NT
: 6♦ 4M (sbsq. 3♣ forces overcaller to TRF to his 4M

3♣
: 6♣ 4M (sbsq. 3♦ forces to bid his 4M)

The above also applies against:  
1. 2NT opening (very sound and excellent ODR)
2. after Kokish relay sequences (very sound and excellent ODR)
3. after Multi sequences (very sound and excellent ODR)
4. 1♣-(1NT) X for PEN here, no way to show clubs or 5m4M
5. (1♣)-p-(1NT) give up PEN X here, partner will surely reopen: X = T/o
6. against RAPTOR that has not promised an anchor suit yet

### Against strong NT (14-16+)

X
: forces 2♣ from partner, then:  
<br>

    Pass

    2M
    : 5+♣ 4M

    2NT

#### Exclusion Doubles
When they overcall our puppet to 2m, X is "exclusion", guarantees a fit for any of partner’s hand types and suggest further competition. Logically, this means Advancer holds at least three cards in each of the minor, hearts and spades in (1NT)-2♣-(2x) (e.g. w/Qxx xxx Axxx Qx or Jxxx Qxxx Kxx x or Axxx Axxx xxxx x). On each of the above, aAdvancer should make an ‘exclusion double’ showinga desire to compete to the 3rd level opposite a diamond overcall or a major/minor two-suiter. This tool encourages the 2♣ bidder to continue bidding with the knowledge that partner has values and fitting cards.
