(1♣)-2♣

|            | Passed hand | 4th hand LIVE          | Reopen
| Michaels   | Yes         | Yes (Opening shows 4+) | Yes (Opening shows 4+)       
| Unusual NT | Yes         | Yes                    | No


Mostly sound 55+, rarely you can have only 4 cards in your higher ranking suit.  
Be careful when there is little chance of making a game by both NS and EW.  
You give too much information with two-suited overcall.  
Be careful with Unusual NT, as you give your opposition the choice of two cue-bids.
